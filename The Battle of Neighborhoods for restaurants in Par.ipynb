The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the Paris Region, which has an estimated official 2020 population of 12,278,210, or about 18 percent of the population of France. \n\nParis has been famous for its restaurants. Also, Paris received 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of foreign visitors coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. It was ranked as the second most visited travel destination in the world in 2019, after Bangkok and just ahead of London. These might provide great opportunities for restaurant to offer decilious food for travellers and workers. \n\nThe city of Paris is divided into 20 arrondissements such as Louvre, Bourse, Temple, H\u00f4tel-de-Ville, Panth\u00e9on etc. It is difficult to figure out where will be the great place to open the restaurant. In this project, I will outline the data preparation and then use Foursquare location data and clustering methods to group the Arriondissements to different group by their restaurant venues information.
